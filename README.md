# The personal website of Christiaan Hemerik

This repository contains the raw sourcecode for my personal website: christiaanhemerik.com.

This is the 3rd incarnation of my personal website. Before that, when I was freelancing, I used my company's website works4sure.nl (nonexistent today) as my personal website as well.

## Why it (still) uses Gulp

Yes, it uses Gulp. I hear you think: it's 2021 (at least...), why on earth would you still use Gulp, and not something like, say, Webpack? Good question. The answer is that Gulp still suits this website's use case the best, in my opinion. I use tools like Webpack for bundling JavaScript-powered websites and applications.

This is no such website. Gulp has a clear, easy to understand syntax, is fast enough and still my prime choice if all I need to do is build a simple, static (prototyped) website with nothing but HTML, CSS and a bunch of images.

## Why it has no static site generator or CMS

Again, it is a simple one page, personal website that is easy to maintain in just the way it is: static code. Also, it features no dynamic content like a blog.
